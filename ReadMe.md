#### Over the course of this project, I dive into the world of blockchain development where I deploy smart contracts across local and remote blockchain testnets. So far the contracts are very basic, but as I progress and learn more, my goal is to develop more complex contracts using different token standards as well as creating some advanced NFTs, and even creating my own Dapp which I will deploy to a live cloud service provider.

## Smart Lotto
#### Users can enter lottery with Eth based on a USD fee
#### An admin will choose when the lottery is over
#### The lottery will select a random winner
#### Note: This application will technically not be decentralized since there is an admin and the admin chooses when to end the lottery. It can be adjusted though
#### To use random functions, I use True Randomness with Chainlink VRF
#### I write smart contracts that interact with both ETH and LINK
