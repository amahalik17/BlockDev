# BlockDev
#
## Active Project
#
## Languages/Frameworks/Packages/Libraries Used
#### Python --- Web3, Brownie
#### Solidity --- Ganache/Ganache-CLI
#### NodeJs
#
#### Over the course of this project, I dive into the world of blockchain development where I deploy smart contracts across local and remote blockchain testnets. So far the contracts are very basic, but as I progress and learn more, my goal is to develop more complex contracts using different token standards as well as creating some advanced NFTs, and even creating my own Dapp which I will deploy to a live cloud service provider.
#
## Brownie 1st and 2nd
#### The first two brownie projects I work on, very basic scipts and smart contracts, using Python, Web3, Brownie, and NodeJs. I learn to deploy my scripts and smart contracts to local blockchains spun up by ganache, as well as live blockchain testnets, like rinkeby.
#
## Smart Lotto
#### Users can enter lottery with Eth based on a USD fee
#### An admin will choose when the lottery is over
#### The lottery will select a random winner
#### Note: This application will technically not be decentralized since there is an admin and the admin chooses when to end the lottery. It can be adjusted though
#### To use random functions, I use True Randomness with Chainlink VRF
#### I write smart contracts that interact with both ETH and LINK
#
## Chainlink Mix
#### The command 'brownie bake chainlink-mix' will initialize the chainlink template with a ton of boiler plate code to build a project upon. I added the template to this folder just for future referencing.
#
## ERC20-Project
#### In this project I am creating my own ERC20 token, using the openzeppelin standard, soon I will run it on the Ethereum mainnet, not just local testnets, still have to run tests and do some fine tuning
