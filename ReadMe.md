#### Over the course of this project, I dive into the world of blockchain development where I deploy smart contracts across local and remote blockchain testnets. So far the contracts are very basic, but as I progress and learn more, my goal is to develop more complex contracts using different token standards as well as creating some advanced NFTs, and even creating my own Dapp which I will deploy to a cloud service provider.
