### This project is a blockchain development project, primarily written in Python and Solidity. Throughout the project I use web3.py, brownie, and ganache to deploy smart contracts across mutiple blockchain testnets. Stay tuned for more updates to the project daily, I am following along with the freecodecamp.org 16 hour blockchain development course on youtube.com
